# Song_Randomizer
The SongShuffler class shuffles and plays songs without repetition. It selects a song from the unplayed portion, swaps it to the end to mark it as played, and shrinks the unplayed pool. Once all songs are played, it resets to allow another shuffled round. This ensures all songs are played once before repeating.
